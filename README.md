# Getting Started with this template

This project is a template to quickly get a new React project up and running. It was generated by Create React App, and filled with various features:

- Basic CRA features (link)
- ESLint with [Airbnb Javascript style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
- Prettier enforcing the eslint rulse
- Various other scripts

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `yarn test`
